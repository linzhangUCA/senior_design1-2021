# Briefing
- Read [instructions](https://docs.donkeycar.com/) of Donkey Car. Clone [code](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar.git) to your Donkey, play with it and hack it.
- Figure out an application you want to realize. [Train a autopilot](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/train_autopilot/) could be a great one, but you can definitely come up with your own.

**Go Team Trojan Donkey!**
